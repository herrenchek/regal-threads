                <h2>Gentlemen's Clothier and Stylist</h2>
                <p>A magician of sorts, Mary Theresa says of Regal Threads, President/Owner of her Manhattan-based,
                    men’s private-label, custom-clothing company. “We’re changing the way men view their wardrobes and
                    showing them how staying up-to-date can be an effortless process.”</p>
                <p>Upon growing up in the clothing trade and involved in women’s wear for twenty years, Mary Theresa
                    always knew menswear was her calling. Having a passion at a very young age for style, color and
                    design, Sciandra chose studies and attended Misericordia University in Pennsylvania where she earned
                    a BA in home economics, specializing in fashion design and merchandising.</p>
                <p>Using her innate creative talents, with years of expertise and a keen eye to detail – she boasts an
                    established reputation in client services. Regal Thread clients are accomplished, successful men who
                    appreciate luxury and a professional service to simplify their busy lives.</p>
                <p>Most men find shopping difficult and at the same time understand the importance of a well coordinated
                    appearance. Mary Theresa makes sure that her clients have a wardrobe that meets their expectations
                    professionally and personally. She applies her skills to fit the clients physical frame, prepares
                    luxurious cloths of specific design, then styles the garments individually with undivided attention
                    to detail, as for her – “it’s all about the client!”</p>
                <p>“I established Regal Threads to make dressing well simple for the men who don’t have the time,
                    interest or expertise to coordinate clothing themselves.”</p>
                <p>“My clients appreciate Regal Threads and respect the services I provide for them. They absolutely
                    enjoy the personalized attention ~ it would be my pleasure to do the same for you.”</p>
                <p>Today, even after fifteen plus years in the business, her face lights up when talking about nothing
                    better than a well dressed man and the satisfaction of her clients receiving many compliments.
                    Busier than ever as word of her artistry spreads, she works with individuals in New York, The
                    Hamptons, Philadelphia, Washington, DC., and beyond.</p>
                <p>“You will love my intentions to spoil you with luxury and service for your brand-new wardrobe attire.
                    I invite you to Regal Threads!”</p>
